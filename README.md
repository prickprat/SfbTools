Mocker is PESSIMISTIC: Does not execute any mockMessages if any are malformed.
    Parse FIRST and validate BEFORE Running -- avoid dirty tests.

CLEANUP needs to be done within each Test

EDGE Case testing


how do you write a query to a different database?

Error Checking on configuration class instantiation

timestamp conversion util>> dateutils

SQL SERVER connection error handling.


Better Logging:
    Error Logging
    Debug logging
    Print statements

Full Mock Test With SQlite3::

    cxn = pyodbc.connect("DRIVER={SQLite3 ODBC Driver};SERVER=localhost;DATABASE=C:/Users/prickprat/Documents/Programming/SqliteDatabases/test.db;Trusted_connection=yes")

If no timestamp found default to 0 interval , log warning.

VALIDATE USING XSD before executing
